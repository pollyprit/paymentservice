Payment service deals with the payments for our e-commerce application. It integrates with Third-Party payments service providers like Razor Pay or Stripe. This also simplifies our application architecture where we donâ€™t have to deal with sensitive information on behalf of our users.

Primary functionalities provided by the Payment Service:
a.	Make a payment
b.	Call a webhook

REST endpoints:
 POST /payment
 POST /webhook
